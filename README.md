# Impala Studio QA Assignment

This folder contains a collection of trace files and a video demonstration related to specific sessions.

## Contents
- **Trace Files**: In the `tarces` directory, there's a mix of `.trace` files containing session data, with one file compressed as a `.zip`.
- **Video File**: An `.mp4` video named `gap_appears_after_expanding_days_in_next_10_days_section.mp4`, demonstrating a specific UI bug.

## Instructions

After downloading the repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `tarces` directory:
   ```bash
   cd tarces
   ```
2. Unzip the compressed trace file and remove the `.zip` file:
   ```bash
   unzip -o chrls_session_160820241527.trace.zip && rm chrls_session_160820241527.trace.zip
   ```

This will extract the trace file and clean up the zipped archive, leaving only the necessary files for the assignment.
